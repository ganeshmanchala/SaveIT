This is my first complete Full Stack Project.
The idea for this project is to share the food between people who have excess food to the people who need the food. This idea came into my mind after seeing the food waste
in my hostel and on other hand there are people on the roads without food.

But main motive of doing this project is to test and show case my MERN skills.

This website also launched in the hosting site : Link: https://save-it-ten.vercel.app/
Frontend is hosted in the vercel and backend in the Render, Database in Atlus MongoDB
These are free of cost hosting , so for the first Backend request it may take time ...


Process:
As we can see below, the persons with excess of food will upload them. And the other people can see them and , using the Map help they can reach the provider place and 
can collect the food.
There are many changes need to be done for full access. But for now I made till this one.
